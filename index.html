        <img src="img/yangatowerclock.jpg" alt="clocktower" id="tower" />
  <p1>The V&A Waterfront <strong>Clock Tower</strong> is situated in Table Bay Harbour,<br>
    close to the site of the original Bertie's Landing restaurant.<br>
    Much of the Waterfront's charm lies in the fact that this busy commercial
    <br>harbour is set in the midst of a huge entertainment venue with restaurants, <br>
    specialty shops, craft markets, theatres and movies.

      <p3><strong>The Swing Bridge,</strong>swings over the link between the Alfred Basin and the Victoria Basin in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront.
        <br>It was designed and constructed in 1997.
      Walking to the pier head to stop over at the Clock Tower precinct or to board the Robben Island ferry brings you to the pedestrian swing bridge,
       an innovative bridge designed to swing over the waterway to allow shipping into and out of the Alfred Basin.
      The bridge is automatic but can be manually operated in the event of failure.</p>
